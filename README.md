# Building a Static Website

To build a static website, you need to understand the three core web technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 1. HTML – Structure
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of every website.  
It is used to create the structure and content of web pages, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

**What to learn:**
- Basic tags (`html`, `head`, `body`)
- Text elements (`h1–h6`, `p`, `span`)
- Links and images (`a`, `img`)
- Lists and forms

## 2. CSS – Styling
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the appearance of your website.  
With CSS, you can define layouts, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness.

**What to learn:**
- Selectors and properties
- Colors, fonts, and spacing
- Box model
- Layout systems (Flexbox, Grid)
- Responsive design

## 3. JavaScript – Interactivity
JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to your website.  
It allows you to respond to user actions, manipulate content, and create engaging experiences.

**What to learn:**
- Variables and functions
- Events (clicks, input, load)
- DOM manipulation
- Basic logic and conditions

## Summary
- **HTML** creates the structure  
- **CSS** styles the appearance  
- **JavaScript** adds interactivity  

Together, these technologies allow you to build modern static websites.
